/**
 * <p>The <code>HGAtomCache</code> interface abstracts the HyperGraph
 * caching activities in order for different caching policies and implementations
 * to be configured and plugged. A successful caching policy will largely depend 
 * on a particular application. For instance, some applications may maintain most HyperGraph
 * atoms within their own data structures whilst others would entirely rely on HyperGraph
 * and continuously query for atoms on a need by need basis. 
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The cache is reminiscent to a memory manager. Both HyperGraph and its
 * HGTypeSystem rely on the cache to manage live vs. persistent information.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This interface is made public in order to allow for custom plugging of atom caching
 * policies. It is <strong>never</strong> to be used directly be applications.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The <code>HGAtomCache</code> is responsible for the following:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>Manage run-time instances of atoms.</li>
 * <li>Create live handle for newly loaded atoms.</li>
 * <li>Generate an <code>HGAtomEvictedEvent</code> for every atom that is removed 
 * from the cache.</li>
 * <li>Cache and manages incidence sets on a per-atom basis.</li>
 * <li>Provide mappings between atoms' live handles and their persistence handles.</li> 
 * </ul>
 * </p>
