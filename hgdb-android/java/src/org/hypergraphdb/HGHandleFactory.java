 * <p>
 * The <code>HGHandleFactory</code> is used to manage persistent handles
 * for the atoms of {@link HyperGraph} instance. One such factory is configured
 * per HyperGraphDB instance via the {@link HGConfiguration} passed when the instance
 * is opened. The factory is responsible for creating new {@link HGPersistentHandle}s
 * that must be unique at least within the current database instance. Certain factories
 * can also guarantee universal uniqueness (e.g. in a distributed environment or across
 * the Internet). Factories are also responsible for creating handle out of their
 * <code>String</code> or <code>byte[]</code> representations. The main requirement that 
 * a handle factory implementation must observe is that all
 * persistent handles must be of the exact same <code>byte[]</code> size. For example, this
 * rules out the use of URIs as persistent handles.
