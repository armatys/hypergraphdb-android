 * A <code>HGPersistentHandle</code> is a <code>HGHandle</code> that survives system
 * downtime. That is, a permanent handle will be valid between startup and shutdown of a
 * HyperGraph based application. 
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A concrete implementation is guaranteed to be a compact, serialiazable Java object that
 * can be stored by the application using some other means and reused to refer to the same 
 * atom in subsequent runs of the same HyperGraph instance, or within a distributed environment.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Generally, plain <code>HGHandle</code> implementation are designed for fast, in-memory 
 * access whereas <code>HGPersistentHandle</code> are designed as a persistent, long-term reference.
