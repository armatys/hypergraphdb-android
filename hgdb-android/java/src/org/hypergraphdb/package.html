<h2>Welcome to HyperGraphDB</h2>
<p>
This package is the main entry point to the HyperGraphDB API. Most of the core interfaces
for search and manipulating HyperGraph atoms are defined here.
</p>
<p>
The main class is the <code>HyperGraph</code> which represents a single HyperGraph
database. You will need to familiarize yourself with most of the methods of that
class in order to use HyperGraphDB effectively. 
</p>
<p>
The full querying API can be found in the <code>org.hypergraphdb.query</code> package. However
most of the functionality is conveniently exposed from the <code>HGQuery.hg</code> class. 
</p>
<p>
More involved graph-based algorithms can be found in the <code>org.hypergraph.algorithms</code>
package.
